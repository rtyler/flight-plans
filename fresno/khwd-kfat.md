# KHWD -> KFAT

Why would you ever go to Fresno, on *purpose*?


* Planned time of departure: 19:00Z (12:00 PDT)
* Planned cruise altitude: 8,000ft MSL

## Route

The route I've selected will basically airport-hop down the central valley,
overpassing many uncontrolled fields between Modesto
([KMOD](http://www.airnav.com/airport/KMOD)) and Fresno
([KFAT](http://www.airnav.com/airport/KFAT)). The western portion of the
central valley would also be an option, but the route between Modesto and
Fresno not only contains plenty of runways, but also follows rail lines between
the two cities.

There **is** airway V-23 which covers the route from MOD to FAT, but it is to
the east of the airport-hop-route by about 13nm.
