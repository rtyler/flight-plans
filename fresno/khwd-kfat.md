## Route

The route I've selected will basically airport-hop down the central valley, overpassing many uncontrolled fields between Modesto ([KMOD](http://www.airnav.com/airport/KMOD)) and Fresno ([KFAT](http://www.airnav.com/airport/KFAT)]. The western portion of the central valley would also be an option, but the route between Modesto and Fresno not only contains plenty of runways, but also follows rail lines between the two cities.
